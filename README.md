## 🎮 About the Project
LevelUP++ is a console-based C++ interactive game designed to help learners practice programming fundamentals. Built from scratch using C++, the game offers login functionality, level-wise quizzes, and even lets users compare their own .cpp files with correct versions for advanced learning.

It was created as a university project but matured into a smart, gamified learning experience for anyone wanting to strengthen their programming basics.
